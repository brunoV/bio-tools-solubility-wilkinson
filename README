NAME
    Bio::Tools::Solubility::Wilkinson - Calculate the probability of a
    protein to be soluble using the Wilkinson-Harrison model

VERSION
    version 0.100890

SYNOPSIS
        use Bio::Tools::Solubility::Wilkinson;

        my $seq = 'MMAEELLVIKP...';

        my $s = solubility($seq);

DESCRIPTION
    This module implements a simple method for the prediction of protein
    solubility, as described by Wilkinson, D.L. and Harrison [1] and
    modified by Davis [2]. It only takes the primary sequence of the protein
    as a parameter, and returns the calculated probability that the protein
    will be expressed in soluble form in *E. Coli*.

    It uses aminoacid composition to compute the two main parameters found
    to have strong correlation with solubility: charge average and turn
    forming residue fraction. For a detailed description of the formula
    used, check the article by Harrison [3] in the References section.

METHODS
  solubility
    Returns the probability of the sequence $seq being soluble. $seq should
    be a correct and validated protein sequence written in one-letter
    aminoacid code. Any whitespace (spaces, newlines, tabs, etc) will be
    ignored.

        my $probability = solubility($seq);

    This function is exported by default.

Customize your imports
    If you'd like to rename the only imported subroutine for some reason,
    you can do:

        use Bio::Tools::Solubility::Wilkinson
            solubility => { -as => 'solubility_wilkinson' };

        use Some::Other::Solubility::Module 'solubility_foo';

        my $p1 = solubility_wilkinson($seq);
        my $p2 = solubility_foo($seq);

    This (and other goodies) are possible thanks to Sub::Exporter, which is
    worth checking out.
